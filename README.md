## Description

This repository allows to replicate results from the article XXX. The scripts follow a linear workflow from scripts starting by 1 to 5 (Figure 1):

* Scripts starting with a 1. They correspond to the ICCAT catch and effort data preparation and the EOF analysis of effortA (article Figure 3).

* Scripts starting with a 2. They correspond to SSTA data preparation for temporal evolution analysis (also for effort evolution analysis, article Figure 1) and EOF analysis of SSTA (article Figure 3).

* Script number 3 correlates temporal structures of effortA and SSTA from EOF analysis.

* Scripts starting with a 4 produce COG analysis (article Figure 2).

* Scripts starting with a 5 produce random forest analysis (article Figures 4 and 5).
